Escrevi feito doida enquanto o L√©o n√£o dava as caras e depois da sua chegada, entre uma mamada e outra, uma troca de fralda e outra, fui postando relatos das minhas experi√™ncias e descobertas no rec√©m experimentado universo materno.\r\n\r\nPara minha surpresa, no meio daquela doideira toda, com um beb√™ em um bra√ßo e um laptop em outro, o Macetes de M√£e cresceu (n√£o disse que era como um filho?)! Primeiro veio a Fanpage do MdM, cheia de dicas e inspira√ß√µes sobre os mais variados assuntos dos universos materno e infantil, e em seguida, o Instagram, o Pinterest, o Twitter e o Google+.\r\n\r\nHoje, depois do L√©o, o Macetes de M√£e √© grande fonte de alegria e realiza√ß√£o da minha vida.

Escrevi feito doida enquanto o L√©o n√£o dava as caras e depois da sua chegada, entre uma mamada e outra, uma troca de fralda e outra, fui postando relatos das minhas experi√™ncias e descobertas no rec√©m experimentado universo materno.\r\n\r\nPara minha surpresa, no meio daquela doideira toda, com um beb√™ em um bra√ßo e um laptop em outro, o Macetes de M√£e cresceu (n√£o disse que era como um filho?)!

Escrevi feito doida enquanto o L√©o n√£o dava as caras e depois da sua chegada, entre uma mamada e outra, uma troca de fralda e outra, fui postando relatos das minhas experi√™ncias e descobertas no rec√©m experimentado universo materno.\r\n\r\nPara minha surpresa, no meio daquela doideira toda, com um beb√™ em um bra√ßo e um laptop em outro, o Macetes de M√£e cresceu (n√£o disse que era como um filho?)! Primeiro veio a Fanpage do MdM, cheia de dicas e inspira√ß√µes sobre os mais variados assuntos dos universos materno e infantil, e em seguida, o Instagram, o Pinterest, o Twitter e o Google+.\r\n\r\nHoje, depois do L√©o, o Macetes de M√£e √© grande fonte de alegria e realiza√ß√£o da minha vida.

Escrevi feito doida enquanto o L√©o n√£o dava as caras e depois da sua chegada, entre uma mamada e outra, uma troca de fralda e outra, fui postando relatos das minhas experi√™ncias e descobertas no rec√©m experimentado universo materno.\r\n\r\nPara minha surpresa, no meio daquela doideira toda, com um beb√™ em um bra√ßo e um laptop em outro, o Macetes de M√£e cresceu (n√£o disse que era como um filho?)! Primeiro veio a Fanpage do MdM, cheia de dicas e inspira√ß√µes sobre os mais variados assuntos dos universos materno e infantil, e em seguida, o Instagram, o Pinterest, o Twitter e o Google+.\r\n\r\nHoje, depois do L√©o, o Macetes de M√£e √© grande fonte de alegria e realiza√ß√£o da minha vida.

Escrevi feito doida enquanto o L√©o n√£o dava as caras e depois da sua chegada, entre uma mamada e outra, uma troca de fralda e outra, fui postando relatos das minhas experi√™ncias e descobertas no rec√©m experimentado universo materno.\r\n\r\nPara minha surpresa, no meio daquela doideira toda, com um beb√™ em um bra√ßo e um laptop em outro, o Macetes de M√£e cresceu (n√£o disse que era como um filho?)! Primeiro veio a Fanpage do MdM, cheia de dicas e inspira√ß√µes sobre os mais variados assuntos dos universos materno e infantil, e em seguida, o Instagram, o Pinterest, o Twitter e o Google+.\r\n\r\nHoje, depois do L√©o, o Macetes de M√£e √© grande fonte de alegria e realiza√ß√£o da minha vida.

Escrevi feito doida enquanto o L√©o n√£o dava as caras e depois da sua chegada, entre uma mamada e outra, uma troca de fralda e outra, fui postando relatos das minhas experi√™ncias e descobertas no rec√©m experimentado universo materno.\r\n\r\nPara minha surpresa, no meio daquela doideira toda, com um beb√™ em um bra√ßo e um laptop em outro, o Macetes de M√£e cresceu (n√£o disse que era como um filho?)! Primeiro veio a Fanpage do MdM, cheia de dicas e inspira√ß√µes sobre os mais variados assuntos dos universos materno e infantil, e em seguida, o Instagram, o Pinterest, o Twitter e o Google+.\r\n\r\nHoje, depois do L√©o, o Macetes de M√£e √© grande fonte de alegria e realiza√ß√£o da minha vida.

Escrevi feito doida enquanto o L√©o n√£o dava as caras e depois da sua chegada, entre uma mamada e outra, uma troca de fralda e outra, fui postando relatos das minhas experi√™ncias e descobertas no rec√©m experimentado universo materno.\r\n\r\nPara minha surpresa, no meio daquela doideira toda, com um beb√™ em um bra√ßo e um laptop em outro, o Macetes de M√£e cresceu (n√£o disse que era como um filho?)! Primeiro veio a Fanpage do MdM, cheia de dicas e inspira√ß√µes sobre os mais variados assuntos dos universos materno e infantil, e em seguida, o Instagram, o Pinterest, o Twitter e o Google+.\r\n\r\nHoje, depois do L√©o, o Macetes de M√£e √© grande fonte de alegria e realiza√ß√£o da minha vida.

Escrevi feito doida enquanto o L√©o n√£o dava as caras e depois da sua chegada, entre uma mamada e outra, uma troca de fralda e outra, fui postando relatos das minhas experi√™ncias e descobertas no rec√©m experimentado universo materno.\r\n\r\nPara minha surpresa, no meio daquela doideira toda, com um beb√™ em um bra√ßo e um laptop em outro, o Macetes de M√£e cresceu (n√£o disse que era como um filho?)! Primeiro veio a Fanpage do MdM, cheia de dicas e inspira√ß√µes sobre os mais variados assuntos dos universos materno e infantil, e em seguida, o Instagram, o Pinterest, o Twitter e o Google+.\r\n\r\nHoje, depois do L√©o, o Macetes de M√£e √© grande fonte de alegria e realiza√ß√£o da minha vida.
